# Categorization-System
categorization system with two phase binary search tree

In this assignment, you are expected to create a two-phase binary search tree (TPBST) structure,
in which each node of main Binary Search Tree (BST) keeps a pointer to its own uniquely associated
secondary BST. You will use this specialized two-phase binary search tree structure as the inmemory database of a webstore that has different categories and items belongs to categories.
